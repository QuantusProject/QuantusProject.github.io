			<h4>Can the information in the shaded link box under the text snippet be used in the question? </h4>
			<p>Information from the link provided can be used in the question only if the fact has that information
				fully contained. If information is missing then please add fact with full information and select that
				fact in your annotation.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4>In case the text itself does not have an entity/topic, but the link provided has, can we use the
				entity/topic in the question? For example, the text that doesn't have the words "Joe Biden" in it but
				has a link below it that says "Joe Biden Wikipedia," can we ask a question about "Joe Biden"?</h3>
				<p>For the case where the text does not have the words Joe Biden but link points to Joe Biden's page -
					firstly confirm the wiki page is indeed referencing him in the paragraph. Please add new fact with
					full information containing name Joe Biden and use it in your annotation.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4>Does that information count when determining if the question can be answered by only one of the facts?
			</h4>
			<p>
				Ideally, we want to find questions that need reasoning over multiple facts - each fact providing
				distinct information. If your question can be answered completely just from one fact then it is not a
				valid question.
