    <p>Hi!</p>
    <h5>April 15 update: </h5>
    <di>
      <p>Thanks for judging the first batch of question-writing with prompts as textual facts.</p>
      <p>Some tips/suggestions : <b style="color:red">make sure your questions are not just Yes/No type of variations</b>. 
        Also, when you select facts make sure the answer for the question requires <b style="color:red">distinct information 
        from ALL of your selected facts</b> to derive the answer. If answer is completely contained in one fact then the 
        judgment does not qualify as valid. </p>
      <p>For textual prompts - all the turkers working on question-writing for image batches are automatically qualified!
        Please let us know if any aspect of this HIT is unclear. We will try and iterate together.</p>
      <p>Wish you all the best. Looking forward to your comments and feedbacks! </p>
