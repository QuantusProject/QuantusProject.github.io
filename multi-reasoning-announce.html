      <p>============================================================================================================</p>
      <p>Thanks for all your hard work. We are planning to go big and upload more and more hits in coming weeks and need
        your help to get good quality examples! </p>
      <p><b>Some important tips/suggestions: </b></br>
      <p>1. Information from the link provided can be used in the question only if the fact has that information fully
        contained. <b style="color:maroon">If information is missing then please add fact with full information</b> and
        select that fact in your annotation. </p>
      <p>2. You can now <b style="color:fuchsia">copy-paste easily</b> with fact highlight feature - just highlight the
        piece of text and you will see a <span class="fa fa-copy"><b style="color:fuchsia"> copy icon</b></span> on left
        of highlighted text to quickly
        copy and lookup and do further research if needed. </p>
      3. <b style="color:green">Answer in fully formed sentences are preferable. </b></br>
      4. <b style="color:red">Make sure your questions are not just Yes/No variations or Comparison type of questions.
      </b></br>
      5. Also, when you select facts make sure the answer for the question requires <b style="color:purple">distinct
        information from ALL of your selected facts</b> to derive the answer. If answer is completely contained in one
      fact then the judgment does not qualify as valid. </p>
      <p>For textual prompts - all the turkers working on question-writing for image batches are automatically
        qualified! Please let us know if any aspect of this HIT is unclear. We will try and iterate together.</p>

      <p>Wish you all the best. Looking forward to your comments and feedbacks! </p>
