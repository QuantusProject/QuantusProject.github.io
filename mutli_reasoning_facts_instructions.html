<h3> What is this HIT about?</h3>
										<p>We are trying to build a question-answering system which is able to retrieve
											the
											answer by reasoning over multiple facts. This is the way we human typically
											use to
											find an answer. For example, when this question is asked:</p>
										<p><b>Has there always been a rivalry between Daffy Duck and Porky Pig?</b></p>
										<p>We might find the answer by</p>
										<ol>
											<li>Searching Wikipedia for <a
													href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daffy_Duck"
													target="_blank">Daffy Duck</a>.</li>
											<li>"Daffy first appeared in <a
													href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porky%27s_Duck_Hunt"
													target="_blank">Porky's Duck Hunt</a>, released on April 17, 1937."
											</li>
											<li>"Porky shoots the whiskey-filled barrel but Daffy escapes" or "Daffy
												bites
												Porky on the nose"</li>
											<li>Conclude, <b>Yes, Daffy and Porky have been rivals since their first
													appearance on screen.</b></li>
										</ol>
										<p>However, for now, if you search a question in a search engine like Google or
											Bing,
											you are mostly like to get the answer from only one snippet of text. They
											don’t have
											the ability to answer the above question because, as you can see, the answer
											is
											concluded by reasoning the facts from multiple resources. We believe that
											this
											reasoning ability can greatly improve the question-answering ability of
											search
											engines, so we create this Hitapp and asking help from you. Appreciate! </p>

										<h3>The Format:</h3>
										<p>Each hit starts with a group of a minimum of 4 text snippets provided by us.
											These
											are somehow related to each other by some common topics or common entities.
											You may
											use these 4 to formulate your questions and are encouraged to add more
											related text
											snippets if those are needed to formulate your question.</p>


										<h3>A valid annotation should include:</h3>
																		<ol>
									<li>Select <b style="color:red">two or more text snippets</b> fom the given group
										.This should include any new facts that you may have added.</li>
									<li>For your convenience you can use the highlighting feature we provide to
										highlight part of text/keywords in given facts. These should help you to
										organize, capture and refer back main thoughts while formulating a multi-hop
										reasoning question. </li>
									<li>Ask a question about the <b style="color:red">text snippets you select</b>. To get the answer to question must <b style="color:green">need distinct info from multiple facts</b>.</li>
									<li>Write down the <b style="color:red">correct answer of your query</b>. The answer
										should be <b>concluded
											from ALL</b> text snippets you selected.</li>

								</ol>

										<h3> Adding facts: </h3>
																		<p>Feel free to add new fact if the given facts are not enough to format new question
									and answer. Follow the following instruction</p>
								<ol>
									<li>The new fact should be somehow <b>related to the given one</b>;</li>
									<li>The new fact should be <b>complicated enough</b>, and the <b>surrending text</b>
										should also
										be included.</li>
									<li>All new fact should be <b>extract from webpage</b>, please also provide the URL
										to the
										webpage in the given field.</li>
									<li>Plase <b>DO NOT</b> make up any fact by yourself.</li>
								</ol>

										<h3>Some other requests:</h3>
										<ol>
											<li>
												Shouldn’t be answered by only one fact:
												<p>Facts:</p>
												<ol>
													<li>Hawa was born on December 16th, 1937 in Umarwas.</li>
													<li>Hawa enrolled in the Indian Army in 1956, and became the
														champion of the
														Western Command in 1960 by defeating the defending champion,
														Mohabbat
														Singh.</li>
												</ol>
												<p><span style="color:red">Bad question:</span>When is Hawa’s
													birthday.(can be
													answer by the first fact)</p>
												<p><span style="color:green">Good question:</span> How old was Hawa when
													he
													enrolled in the Indian Army? (need both facts)</p>
											</li>
											<li>Has definitive answer: The answer to your query cannot be too subjective
												or
												change from time to time.
												<ul>
													<li>How good is the view of Chicage from Willis Tower skydeck? (Too
														subjective)</li>
													<li>What is the weather in Manhattan? (Time sensitive)</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>
												Not about simple facts: The query cannot be answered blindly based on
												common
												sense (i.e. without using any of the text snippets).
												<ul>
													<li>Can a boat float on the water?</li>
													<li>How many wheels does a car have?</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>more...</li>
										</ol>
