	<h3> What is this HIT about?</h3>
	<p>We are trying to build a question-answering system which is able to retrieve
		the
		answer by reasoning over multiple facts. This is the way we human typically
		use to
		find an answer. For example, when this question is asked:</p>
	<p><b>Has there always been a rivalry between Daffy Duck and Porky Pig?</b></p>
	<p>We might find the answer by</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Searching Wikipedia for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daffy_Duck" target="_blank">Daffy Duck</a>.
		</li>
		<li>"Daffy first appeared in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porky%27s_Duck_Hunt" target="_blank">Porky's
				Duck Hunt</a>, released on April 17, 1937."
		</li>
		<li>"Porky shoots the whiskey-filled barrel but Daffy escapes" or "Daffy
			bites
			Porky on the nose"</li>
		<li>Conclude, <b>Yes, Daffy and Porky have been rivals since their first
				appearance on screen.</b></li>
	</ol>
	<p>However, for now, if you search a question in a search engine like Google or
		Bing,
		you are mostly like to get the answer from only one snippet of text. They
		don’t have
		the ability to answer the above question because, as you can see, the answer
		is
		concluded by reasoning the facts from multiple resources. We believe that
		this
		reasoning ability can greatly improve the question-answering ability of
		search
		engines, so we create this Hitapp and asking help from you. Appreciate! </p>

	<h3>The Format:</h3>
	<p>Each hit starts with a group of a minimum of 4 text snippets provided by us.
		These
		are somehow related to each other by some common topics or common entities.
		You may
		use these 4 to formulate your questions and are encouraged to add more
		related text
		snippets if those are needed to formulate your question.</p>


	<h3>A valid annotation should include:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Select <b style="color:red">two or more text snippets</b> fom the given group
			.This should include any new facts that you may have added.</li>
		<li>For your convenience you can use the highlighting feature we provide to
			highlight part of text/keywords in given facts. These should help you to
			organize, capture and refer back main thoughts while formulating a multi-hop
			reasoning question. </li>
		<li>Ask a question about the <b style="color:red">text snippets you select</b>. To get the answer to question
			must <b style="color:green">need distinct info from multiple facts</b>.</li>
		<li>Write down the <b style="color:red">correct answer of your query</b>. The answer
			should be <b>concluded
				from ALL</b> text snippets you selected.</li>

	</ol>

	<h3> Adding facts: </h3>
	<p>Feel free to add new fact if the given facts are not enough to format new question
		and answer. Follow the following instruction</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The new fact should be somehow <b>related to the given one</b>;</li>
		<li>The new fact should be <b>complicated enough</b>, and the <b>surrending text</b>
			should also
			be included.</li>
		<li>All new fact should be <b>extract from webpage</b>, please also provide the URL
			to the
			webpage in the given field.</li>
		<li>Plase <b>DO NOT</b> make up any fact by yourself.</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Some other requests:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Shouldn’t be answered by only one fact:
			<p>Facts:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Hawa was born on December 16th, 1937 in Umarwas.</li>
				<li>Hawa enrolled in the Indian Army in 1956, and became the
					champion of the
					Western Command in 1960 by defeating the defending champion,
					Mohabbat
					Singh.</li>
			</ol>
			<p><span style="color:red">Bad question:</span>When is Hawa’s
				birthday.(can be
				answer by the first fact)</p>
			<p><span style="color:green">Good question:</span> How old was Hawa when
				he
				enrolled in the Indian Army? (need both facts)</p>
		</li>
		<li>Has definitive answer: The answer to your query cannot be too subjective
			or
			change from time to time.
			<ul>
				<li>How good is the view of Chicage from Willis Tower skydeck? (Too
					subjective)</li>
				<li>What is the weather in Manhattan? (Time sensitive)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			Not about simple facts: The query cannot be answered blindly based on
			common
			sense (i.e. without using any of the text snippets).
			<ul>
				<li>Can a boat float on the water?</li>
				<li>How many wheels does a car have?</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>
