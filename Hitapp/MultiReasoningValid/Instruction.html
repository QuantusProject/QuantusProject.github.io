	<h3> What is this HIT about?</h3>
	<p>We are trying to build a question-answering system which is able to retrieve
		the
		answer by reasoning over multiple facts. This is the way we human typically
		use to
		find an answer. For example, when this question is asked:</p>
	<p><b>Has there always been a rivalry between Daffy Duck and Porky Pig?</b></p>
	<p>We might find the answer by</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Searching Wikipedia for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daffy_Duck" target="_blank">Daffy Duck</a>.
		</li>
		<li>"Daffy first appeared in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porky%27s_Duck_Hunt" target="_blank">Porky's
				Duck Hunt</a>, released on April 17, 1937."
		</li>
		<li>"Porky shoots the whiskey-filled barrel but Daffy escapes" or "Daffy
			bites
			Porky on the nose"</li>
		<li>Conclude, <b>Yes, Daffy and Porky have been rivals since their first
				appearance on screen.</b></li>
	</ol>
	<p>However, for now, if you search a question in a search engine like Google or
		Bing,
		you are mostly like to get the answer from only one snippet of text. They
		don’t have
		the ability to answer the above question because, as you can see, the answer
		is
		concluded by reasoning the facts from multiple resources. We believe that
		this
		reasoning ability can greatly improve the question-answering ability of
		search
		engines, so we create this Hitapp and asking help from you. Appreciate! </p>
	<h3>The Format:</h3>
	<p>In each hit, you will see a group of QnA pairs with supporting facts. Your task is to determine if shown QnA pair
		is a good reasoning based QnA and needing <b>EACH</b> of the facts shown for distinct information to get the
		answer. </p>


	<h3>A good QnA pair should be:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Shouldn’t be answered by only one fact:
			<p>Facts:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Hawa was born on December 16th, 1937 in Umarwas.</li>
				<li>Hawa enrolled in the Indian Army in 1956, and became the
					champion of the
					Western Command in 1960 by defeating the defending champion,
					Mohabbat
					Singh.</li>
			</ol>
			<p><span style="color:red">Bad question:</span>When is Hawa’s
				birthday.(can be
				answer by the first fact)</p>
			<p><span style="color:green">Good question:</span> How old was Hawa when
				he enrolled in the Indian Army? (need both facts)</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			The Question and Answer should be grammatically correct and has no speeling error;
			<p><span style="color:red">Bad question: </span>Was George a <b>techer</b> when he was 21 years
				old?("Teacher" is spelled wrong)</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			The Question should not be too easy or can be answered by common sense.
			<p><span style="color:red">Bad question: </span> How many wheels does a car have? </p>
			<p><span style="color:darkcyan">Explanation: </span> Since everybody knows a car have 4 wheels in most
				cases, this question does not need to use any facts to answer.</p>
		</li>
		<li>The Question and Answer themselves should be correct.
			<p><span style="color:red">Bad question: </span>Which has stronger smell, rose or flower?</p>
			<p><span style="color:darkcyan">Explanation: </span>rose is a type of flower, so they are not comparable</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			The facts used to answer the question should be reasonably related.
			<p>Facts:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Keanu Reeves was apparently such an outstanding hockey goalie that his college teammates called him
					"The Wall."</li>
				<li>American actor Timothee Chalamet has been dubbed “Sweet Tea” by his fans in China.</li>
			</ol>
			<p><span style="color:red">Bad question: </span>Who's real last name is shorter? "The Wall" or "Sweet Tea"?
			</p>
			<p><span style="color:darkcyan">Explanation: </span>The two provided facts are not talking about same topic,
				does not have same entity. So basically, they are not related. We should avoid such question.</p>
		</li>
		<li>Has definitive answer: The answer to your query cannot be too subjective
			or change from time to time.
			<p><span style="color:red">Bad question: </span>How good is the view of Chicage from Willis Tower skydeck?
				(Too subjective)</p>
			<p><span style="color:red">Bad question: </span>What is the weather in Manhattan? (Time sensitive) </p>

		</li>
		<li></li>
