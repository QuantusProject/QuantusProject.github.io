    <h3>May 20th update:</h3>
    <p>Hi!</p>
    <p>We got some feedback from some workers and here are some clearfication:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>"The facts provided are unrelated in terms of Topic/Key words/Entity" in the "Tell us about the facts"
        section is used to mark if the facts had strong relationship with each other. The Example 5 is an example about
        this case.</li>
      <li>
        The answer should be present in the fact completely and should not need the blue link. The blue link is only
        used to let you understand the topic.
      </li>
      <li>You can use the textbox in "Tell us about this question" to note any problem in the question regardless your
        answer of the "Can you understand what is being asked without reading the facts?".</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>May 17th update: </h3>

      <p>Hi!</p>

        your results and added some more content in the example and QnA section. Please take a look!</p>
      <p>Here are some <b>additional IMPORTANT tips</b>:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Please read and follow all updated instructions and examples carefully.</li>
        <li>Since this is a reasoning task, they need more time and logical thinking to understand. Please give yourself
          some more time for each example.</li>
        <li>Facts may be new topics you have not seen before. Please try to understand the facts, question and answers
          before making the decision.</li>
        <li>Please reach out to us if you have feedback or any questions and we can iterate together!</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>May 17th update: </h3>
      <p>In this HitApp, you will be asked to judge the quality of some multi-reasoning Question-and-Answer(QnA) pairs.
      </p>
      <p>A multi-reasoning QnA pair is one where the <b>answer</b> to the <b>question</b> is derived from information
        from several
        <b>distinct facts</b>/text snippets. We need your help in this validation app to gather great quality examples.
        Please
        reach out to us if you have feedback or any questions and we can iterate together!
      </p>
      <p>More updates including FAQs will keep coming regularly, watch for the updates and we are looking forward to see
