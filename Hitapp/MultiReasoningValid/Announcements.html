      <p>Hi!</p>
      <p>In this HitApp, you will be asked to judge the quality of some multi-reasoning Question-and-Answer(QnA) pairs.
      </p>
      <p>A multi-reasoning QnA pair is one where the <b>answer</b> to the <b>question</b> is derived from information from several
        <b>distinct facts</b>/text snippets. We need your help in this validation app to gather great quality examples. Please
        reach out to us if you have feedback or any questions and we can iterate together!</p>
      <p>More updates including FAQs will keep coming regularly, watch for the updates and we are looking forward to see
        the results from your work!</p>
