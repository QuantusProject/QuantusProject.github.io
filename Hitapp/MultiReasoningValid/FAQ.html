			<h4>Does the facts need to have strong relationship between each other?</h4>
			<p>Yes, the question should not make up relationship between the facts. Instead, the facts themselves should
				be related, either in the same domain or descripbing similar/same entity/topic. For example: "wood" and
				"tree" are some related entity. However, "Panda Express" and "panda" are not, because one is the name of
				a restaurant, but the other one is a kind of animal. Please be careful on this because some terms are
