          help with wherein we just need you to provide us the 'SHORT Answer Phrase' to the question based on the provided
          supporting facts. 
          As always looking forward to any feedback or questions you may have!</span></p>

      <p><b>Some important tips/suggestions: </b></br>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b style="color:green">Answer must be in short phrases ONLY. </b>
        </li>
         <li>
          <b style="color:green">It is usually the keyword(s) answer to the question.</b>
           Example: How old was Einstein's mother when he graduated from university? </br>
           SHORT Answer: 46 years
        </li>
        <li>
          If answer needs to be verbose and cannot be answered with some keywords then write the most succinct phrase to answer it and mark check-box for 'Needs slightly long answer'
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure the answer is derived from all facts/image provided. If additional fact is needed to answer the
          question, then mark the question as "Can't answer this question due to missing facts". (This should be rare)
        </li>
