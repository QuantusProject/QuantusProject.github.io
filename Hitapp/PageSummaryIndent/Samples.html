                1. Does the image/fact
                <strong>help in deriving</strong>
                the answer <strong>completely</strong>
                <br />
                I.e. Answer fully explained by the fact

                    <strong>Question:</strong>
                    "To what country does the Innuitian Region's Queen Elizabeth Islands belong to?"
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Answer:</strong>

                    The Innuitian Region is a physiographic division of Canada's far north. It is one of three
                    physiographic divisions of the Arctic Lands physiographic region, along with the Arctic Coastal
                    Plain, and the Arctic Lowlands. The Queen Elizabeth Islands comprise most of the region, which is
                    also considered to be part of the Arctic Archipelago.

                <strong>help in deriving</strong>
                the answer <strong>partially</strong>
                <br />
                I.e. Some parts of the answer explained by the fact

                <li>
                    <strong>Answer:</strong>
                    "Consider the triangle: Where “a” is the perpendicular, “b” is the
                    base, “c” is the hypotenuse. According to the definition, the
                    Pythagoras Theorem formula is given as: Hypotenuse2 = Perpendicular2
                    + Base2 or c2 = a2 + b2"

                    A right triangle (or right-angled triangle, formerly called a rectangled triangle) has one of its
