        If someone asked for the
        <strong>question</strong>
        , would the
        <strong>image/fact</strong>
        be
        <strong>helpful to derive answer?</strong>

        <h4>Check the question and the answer below as example:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Question:</strong>
                "What is pythagoras theorem?"
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Answer:</strong>
                "Consider the triangle: Where “a” is the perpendicular, “b” is the
                base, “c” is the hypotenuse. According to the definition, the
                Pythagoras Theorem formula is given as: Hypotenuse2 = Perpendicular2
                + Base2 or c2 = a2 + b2"

                1. Does the image/fact
                <strong>help in deriving</strong>
                the answer
                <br />
                I.e. supported by the image

                <br /><br />
                <li>
                    Explanation: The image helps to understand the
                    perpendicular "a", the base "b" and the hypotenuse "c", therefore helps to derive the answer.

                2. Is the image/fact
                <strong>related but not needed</strong>
                to derive the answer
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A right triangle (or right-angled triangle, formerly called a rectangled triangle) has one of its
                    interior angles measuring 90° (a right angle).

                <li>
                    Explanation: The fact is a right triangle, but this
                    triangle has no help to derive answer.
