<p>We are trying to build a question-answering system which is able to retrieve one or more images
	to answer a user&#39;s query.</p>

<p>To explore this problem, we collected <span style="color:blue;">Questions</span>, <span
		style="color:IndianRed;">Answers</span> to those <span style="color:blue;">Questions</span>,
	and <span style="color:green;">Images</span> that imply those <span
		style="color:IndianRed;">Answers</span>. Now we want you to tell us a few things about each
	<span style="color:blue;">Question</span> and <span style="color:blue;">Answer</span>:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Can you understand the <span style="color:blue;">Question</span> <b>without</b> looking at
		an <span style="color:green;">Image</span>?</li>
	<li>Is this <span style="color:Indianred;">Answer</span> really a valid and correct answer?</li>
	<li>Can this <span style="color:Indianred;">Answer</span> be inferred from the <span
			style="color:green;">Image</span>(s)?</li>
	<li>Are at least two <span style="color:green;">Images</span> <b>necessary</b> to answer the
		<span style="color:blue;">Question</span>?</li>
	<li>Do you think there is a mismatch between <span style="color:green;">Image(s)</span> and the
		<span style="color:blue;">Question</span>-<span style="color:Indianred;">Answer</span> pair,
		which might be caused by wrong index selection?
		<div class="tool-tip"><strong><i>i</i></strong> <span class="tooltiptext">In our annotation
				task, we asked Turkers to select one or two image(s) from a group of images and then
				provide a question-answer pair based on the selected image(s). However, occasionally
				the image index(es) could be wrongly selected, which result in us losing track of
				the correct image(s). If you find that the question-answer pair is valid, but it
				seems so weird because the question-answer pair has nothing to with the image(s),
				then there might be a mismatch problem caused by wrong index selection. Select
				&#39;True&#39; if you think there IS such a problem.</span></div>

	You can assume that the meta-data is there to help identify or locate the object of
	interest, as long as the identity or geographic information is not directly asked in the
	question. However, the property from which we directly draw the answer must be presented
	by some visual element in the image.</li>

		style="background-color:rgb(255, 249, 133); color:black;">Be aware of <b>fake
			multi-img</b> questions</span><br />
	For a valid multi-hop sample, the images should be <strong>complementary</strong> rather
	than substitutes for each other. In other words, both images should contain some
	information that the other does not contain. Questions that fail to satisfy this would
	fall into the single-hop bucket.</li>
<li style="padding-top:5px;"><span
		style="background-color:rgb(255, 249, 133); color:black;">De-qualify questions that
		are easily answered by Google/about commonsense/too trivial</span><br />
	Examples of such unqualified questions are like &quot;Are there sidewalks in xxx
	city&quot;, &quot;Are there buses on xxx street&quot;, etc.</li>
<li style="padding-top:5px;"><span
		style="background-color:rgb(255, 249, 133); color:black;">De-qualify incoherent

	The extra explanation beyond &quot;Yes/No&quot; will not by itself determine the
	validity of the answer. Essentially you can ignore the extra explanation and score the
	answer based on its &quot;Yes/No&quot;</li>
