	<h3> Please select ALL the supporting facts from a given list of facts and provide us the full sentence answer to the question.</h3>
	 <ol>
        <li>
          Select <b style="color:green"> ALL those facts/images that are needed to help reason answer</b> to the question from the list of multiple facts provided.
        </li>

        They should be <b style="color:green">complete and grammatically correct.</b>
         </li>
      </ol>
	
	<h3> Background: What is this HIT about?</h3>
	<p>We are trying to build a question-answering system which is able to retrieve
		the answer by reasoning over multiple facts/images. This is the way we human typically
		use to find an answer. For example, when this question is asked:</p>
	<p><b>Has there always been a rivalry between Daffy Duck and Porky Pig?</b></p>
	<p>We might find the answer by</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Searching Wikipedia for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daffy_Duck" target="_blank">Daffy Duck</a>.
		</li>
		<li>"Daffy first appeared in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porky%27s_Duck_Hunt" target="_blank">Porky's
				Duck Hunt</a>, released on April 17, 1937."
		</li>
		<li>"Porky shoots the whiskey-filled barrel but Daffy escapes" or "Daffy
			bites
			Porky on the nose"</li>
		<li>Conclude, <b>Yes, Daffy and Porky have been rivals since their first
				appearance on screen.</b></li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>The Format:</h3>
	<p> Each hit starts with a question and group of candidate facts/images provided by us that we think are have some facts/images needed to answer
		the question. You need to select ALL the facts/images needed to answer the question and also provide the correct answer to the question in FULLY FORMED sentence answer.</p>
	<p> Note: if you think information provided in facts is not enough to answer the question please MARK as <b>cannot be answere</b> and give some comments why you marked so. Note: this shoudl be rare.</p>
	</br>
	Remember the following: 
	<ol>
        <li>
          Select <b style="color:green"> ALL those facts/images that are needed to help reason answer</b> to the question from the list of multiple facts provided.
        </li>
        <li>
          Answer in <b style="color:green">fully formed sentences</b> are required. 
        </li>
        <li>
        They should be <b style="color:green">complete and grammatically correct.</b>
         </li>
      </ol>
