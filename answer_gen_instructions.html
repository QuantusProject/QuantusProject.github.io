	<h3> What is this HIT about?</h3>
	<p>We are trying to build a question-answering system which is able to retrieve the
	answer by reasoning over multiple facts. This is the way we human typically
	use to find an answer. For example, when this question is asked:</p>
	<p><b>Has there always been a rivalry between Daffy Duck and Porky Pig?</b></p>
	<p>We might find the answer by referring FACTS from Wikipedia for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daffy_Duck" target="_blank">Daffy Duck</p></a>
	<ul>

	<li>"Daffy first appeared in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porky%27s_Duck_Hunt" target="_blank">Porky's
	Duck Hunt</a>, released on April 17, 1937."
	</li>
	<li>"Porky shoots the whiskey-filled barrel but Daffy escapes" or "Daffy
	bites
	Porky on the nose"</li>
	<p>Using these 2 facts conclude the FINAL ANSWER as - <b>Yes, Daffy and Porky have been rivals since their first
	appearance on screen.</b></p>
	
	<p>The answer is concluded by reasoning the facts from multiple resources. We believe that
	this reasoning ability can greatly improve the question-answering ability of search
	engines, so we create this Hitapp and asking help from you. Appreciate your participation! </p>
	</ul>
	

	<h3>The New Format:</h3>
	<p>Each hit starts with a question and group of text snippets provided by us that we think are sufficient to answer the question.
	These should contain all the information necessary to answer the question..
	You may use these provided facts *only* to formulate your answers to the question. </br>
	Note: if you think information provided in facts is not enough to answer the question please MARK as cannot be answered.</p>
		

	<h4>Can the information from the URL link of text snippet be used in the answer? </h4>
	<p>Information from the link provided can be used in the answer only if <b>the fact text snippet has that
	information fully contained within it</b>. </p>
